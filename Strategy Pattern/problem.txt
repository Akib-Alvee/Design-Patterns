Suppose you are making a car racing game. Each car in your game has 2 functionalities mainly.
------- The car can move. There are different kinds of moving behaviours, like
    { move very slowly
    { move like a rocket ... etc

------- The car can play horn. It can also be of different types, like
    { play boring horn
    { play disco horn ... etc

When a player starts his career in your game, he is assigned a car that can 
    a) move very slowly 
    b) play boring horn. 

But when the player passes a certain level (or simply pays you
some money) you will allow the car of that player to upgrade. What is your strategy behind
implementing this game?
